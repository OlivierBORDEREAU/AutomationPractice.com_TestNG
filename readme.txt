This is a sample Cucumber-Selenium-Junit sample project created under Eclipse

 - The runner is stored in src/test/java/runner (in your IDE, Execute the runner with "Run as TestNG Test") OR as an usual TestNG test suite from the command line or using the usual Maven command line
 - It will execute the tests associated to 3 scenarios defined in the src/test/resources/featuresautomationpractice.feature file
 	- The automationpractice.com website is a demo site provided by Microfocus for testing purposes, and as such may sometimes at "office hours" display a "Resource Limit Is Reached" message
 		- In that case, retry a bit later...
 
 Remember : 
 get the appropriate Chromedriver for your version of chrome on https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and put it in your path (eventually, add the folder containing chromedriver.exe to your system's user path)
